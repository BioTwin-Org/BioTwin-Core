# BioTwin-Core
 This  is an open-source  framework designed to engineer the next generation of regenerative medicine. It integrates Generative AI ( BioNeMo)  with Multi-Scale Physiological Simulations to design, test, and validate Hormokines  -synthetic signaling molecules that reprogram the body's endocrine system to reverse disease states like fibrosis.
