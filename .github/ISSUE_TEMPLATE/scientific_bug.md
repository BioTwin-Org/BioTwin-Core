**Biological Process Affected**
(e.g., HSC Activation, Hepatocyte Regeneration, TGF-β Signaling)

**The Flaw**
A clear and concise description of why the current simulation logic is inaccurate.

**Suggested Correction**
How should the variables (e.g., `fibrosis_index`, `hsc_activation`) behave instead? 

**Supporting Evidence/References**
Please link to a paper or dataset that supports this change (e.g., PubMed, Nature, bioRxiv).

**Additional Context**
Any other notes on how this affects the "Programmable Body" metaphor.
